As I'm getting close to the end of Coding Dojo's Python Course this last month will focus on algorithims and taking some time to build out my own project from start to finish to showcase to employers. This is also a great time to start thinking about my job search and how I want to network to open some potential job oportunities. I have LinkedIn and Github accounts created, I will begin working to tailor them to increase traffic through my profile and make it easier to network with other members in the tech industry. Contuining to work with Career Services will help me narrow down what exact job title I am interested in and in what field of work I would like to be a developer in.
